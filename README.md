Dark Requiems Custom Files

These files are for use with the Dark Requiem Shadowrun 5e Living Community

In order to use them you'll need to extract the "Dark Requiem house rules" to your Custom Data folder, and if there is not one, you'll need to create one.
you will also move the Dark_Requiem.xml, Dark_Requiem_sum_to_ten.xml, and the Dark_Requiem_Priority.xml files to your "settings" folder.
