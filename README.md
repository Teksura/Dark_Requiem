# Dark_Requiem
These files are for use with Chummer5, a desktop character generator used by the Dark Requiem Shadowrun 5e Living Community.

-----

To download Chummer5 for character generation:  https://github.com/chummer5a/chummer5a/releases/tag/5.225.0

Select the Newest file (not the source code -- scroll to the bottom and use the FIRST zip link).  

If you run into any issues during character generation, note it down in the Character Info or Notes tab of your character sheet and a member of Dark Requiem Staff should be able to manually add it in for you.

-----

Once you download and unzip Chummer:

Click the CODE button on this repository and download everything as a ZIP file.  This results in Dark_Requiemm-main.zip.  Open this zip file, then navigate into the single directory inside it (also named Dark_Requiem-main).

Now just click and drag the customdata and settings folders out of the ZIP file and into your already-unzipped Chummer5 directory.  Allow merge and overwrite - we won't touch anything Chummer needs to work right!
